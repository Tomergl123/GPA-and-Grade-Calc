What is this project?
  This is a project to satisfy the need of knowing your grade or GPA without having to manually calculate it yourself.
  This program will use Algonquin College's GPA calculation formula to calculate your GPA for you. 
  All it'll require from you is which course you'd like to weight it on, the course hours and each assignments respected weight and the grade you got on it.

(WIP and will add features as I go along with it. First project using HTML and CSS so expect rough edges.)
